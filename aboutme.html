    <h2>Zacarias Fernando Nharongue Secane</h2>
    <h3>Ndinho from fernaNDINHO</h3>
    <p>I have a degree in Electronic Engineering.</p>
    <p>I like to enjoy myself challenging myself with new learning and diving into what I don't know.</p>
    <p>I also love to enjoy walks and reading novels, and sometimes I really appreciate just being at home watching TV.</p>
    <p>I'm married to a lovely young woman. And we have got a strong and handsome toddler.</p>
    <p>At the moment, I'm working as a Maintenance Technician. I'm thinking of running my own business or changing my career.</p>
    <p>If there is something that comes up in my mind right now is the fact that in BYU I learn and acquire new skills in an environment where the Lord is praised.</p>
    <p>I'm pursuing a BS in Software Development.</p>
